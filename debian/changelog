gnome-calls (49.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * doap: Add Guido as co-maintainer
  * doap: Update Evangelos email.
    The dropped one isn't used since ages
  * main-window: Drop confusing cast
  * record-store: Track async operations.
    We need to be able to tell when all async operations finished.
    Otherwise we might shut down the daemon with in flight operations
    leaving a open database around.
  * application: Wait until all async database operations finished.
    When shutting down make sure there are no in-flight database operations.
    Otherwise the database might not be closed correctly.
    Improves fix for https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/calls/-/issues/508
  * tests: Make the application test depend on the binary.
    Otherwise it is not rebuilt when it changes
  * application: Actually test for write ahead log.
    While the test was correct and checked if there is only
    `record.db` in a given dir (and no other files) it wouldn't
    tell us whether the file wasn't there or there were additional
    files found. Hence replace the test by assertions that tell
    use exactly what failed easing debugging in CI.
    Fixes: e4bd4580 ("tests: Add application shutdown tests")
  * app: Use automatic cleanup
  * application: Load plugins early.
    Fixes: 574e1f79 ("application: Drop ignore_activation flag")
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/calls/-/issues/718

  * main-window: increase width of switcher breakpoint.
    The current breakpoint is more or less perfect for
    English. However, there are other languages with longer
    strings there, such as German. Increasing the width at
    which the breakpoint sits to switch the switcher location
    enables most languages to have no or minimal ellipses
    while not looking too spacious with English.
  * main-window: move bottom switcher to toolbar.
    The toolbar view is meant for these. This allows
    libadwaita's style to apply the way it can be seen in
    basically every other GNOME app.
    The differences are with the scroll dependent undershoot
    instead of an unconditional border.
  * new-call-box: wrap dialer in scrolled window.
    It was possible to increase the window's size below the
    minimum size of the dialer view. As such it is important
    to wrap it in a scrolled window in order not to lose
    access to otherwise hidden interface components.
    This is, of course, not a replacement for a better
    adapting dialer.
  * contacts-box: adjust search bar's margin inside toolbar.
    A toolbar view, per its docs, expects its toolbar
    children to either be of a set of known widget types that
    are supported by default, or otherwise be a Gtk.Box-like
    container with the .toolbar CSS style class.
    This expectation was not met, but instead similar, but
    not identical margins manually applied. These similar yet
    different margins made it look off.
    While this now adheres to the toolbar child requirements
    of libadwaita, and the margins look more familiar, it
    still breaks with libadwaita's assumption that toolbars
    are not stacked. Its stylesheet allows for stacking
    toolbar views only if one is providing the top and the
    other the bottom one.
    This view, especially, deserves a more thorough design
    overhaul, regardless of this. Thus, I will leave it at
    this.

  * test-application: Check for expected plugins to be loaded.
    These tests helps ensure the application will always have plugins
    loaded and prevent regressions.
    Helps: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/calls/-/issues/718
  * plugin-manager: Add API to unload all plugins.
    And add tests for it.

  * ci: Switch to package test to trixie.
    PureOS Byzantium tracks Debian oldstable which isn't suitable for an
    upstream test. Track Debian testing instead which has recent GNOME.
  * ci: Switch to a trixie based base image.
    Debian Bookworm doesn't get any GNOME updates and we want to ensure

  * dir-locals: Avoid tabs in C mode
  * dir-locals: Ease formatting of CSS, meson and ui files

  * origin: Add network country code.
    This is technically only useful for mobile networks.
  * mm-origin: Get 3gpp network country code when available.
    We currently don't enable location gathering explicitly so we rely
    on other services (like geoclue) to do so. Use
        mmcli -m 0 --location-enable-3gpp
    We could enable for a short time when there's an explicit emergency
    number request.
  * mm-origin: Notify emergency number change when we get a location.
    Technically the emergency numbers exported by the origin doesn't change
    but it's enough to trigger the DBus signal so clients see the updated
    numbers.
  * emergency-call-types: Allow to lookup emergency numbers by country code.
    We build a hash as cache to speed up lookups. As this is a one time
    thing we just do it once and don't bother to free it up.
    We currently assume that all numbers can be used for the location based
    lookups. Should that change we want to add a flag indicating that.
  * emergency-call-types: Use hash for flag lookups too
  * emergency-call-types: Add location source.
    We named it fallback but location is a better name as we get it
    from the current country code.
  * emergency-calls-manager: Fix object name
  * emergency-calls-manager: Move contact adding to separate function.
    Improves readability and will be get another call site soon.
  * emergency-calls-manager: Use network code to get emergency numbers.
    By far not all sims have emergency numbers and we want to respect the
    users current location anyway.
    We use a hash to avoid duplicates.
  * emergency-call-types: Add EU countries.
    They all support 112.
  * calls-manager: Connect listener past the list model filters.
    The list model filters connect signal handlers for item-changed to
    refilter the list models.
    In order to enable protocols based on what the origin supports
    `on_origins_changed` needs these filtered results. Since it is a signal
    handler by itself connect it late so it runs later in the filter chain.
